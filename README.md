# Probabilistic Graphical Inference
Probabilistic Graphical Inference Algorithms - Commonly used for Graph-based Data Structures

Probabilistic Graphical Models exploit depedencies between random variables to create a graph-based representation of joint distributions. These representations are very flexible and are now frequently used in deep learning networks (check out Graph Convolutional Neural Networks, for instance). For more explanation on Probabilistic Graphical Models, check out: http://6.869.csail.mit.edu/fa19/lectures/L10graphicalModelsInference.pdf 

In this work, I implement belief propagation algorithms on Markov Random Fields in the pgm.py file.
